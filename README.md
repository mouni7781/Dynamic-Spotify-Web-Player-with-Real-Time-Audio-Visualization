## ✨ About The Project
This project is a high-fidelity, front-end clone of the Spotify web player. It was built from the ground up using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 to demonstrate a strong understanding of fundamental web technologies without reliance on modern frameworks.

The goal was not just to replicate the look and feel but to engineer core functionalities like dynamic content loading, a fully interactive music player, and a live search feature. The centerpiece of this project is a real-time audio visualizer that uses the Web Audio API and HTML5 Canvas to create an engaging and dynamic user experience that syncs with the music.
